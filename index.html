				<h4>What is NodeSchool Oakland?</h4>
				<p>We're a monthly meetup group that helps people new to JavaScript, Node.js, or programming in general get comfortable with <a href="http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list">self directed lessons</a>. Our meetups are group learning experiences, where people of all skill levels come together to strengthen their understanding of JavaScript.</p>
				<p>As part of our effort to ensure that everyone feels safe and welcome at our events, we ask that all participants follow our <a href="https://github.com/nodeschool/oakland/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
